One of the most challenging machine learning challenges today is applying models to evaluate financial indices or stock prices. Due to the development of machine learn- ing methods, approximations to accurate prediction are emerging. Moreover, modern models, unlike standard econometric methods, are capable of capturing nonlinear pat- terns and complex patterns in the input data. The issue of forecasting accuracy is of interest not only to private investors, but also to large companies and large institutional investors as well. The Russian financial market is developing more and more actively every year, therefore, the search for an optimal model for predicting the main indices of the Russian stock market is an important applied problem.

In our work, we strive to build a model that will predict well the next dayâ€™s stock price. To predict the course, we use an ensemble of different models, trend prediction, and work with news. In the process of selecting the best ensemble, we identify which methods of processing and using information are the best and announce why this is so.

As the main indicator, the values of the Moscow Exchange index were taken, which allows obtaining the knowledge necessary for making important investment decisions. In addition, this index is used as a benchmark for building the absolute majority of Russian index mutual funds. Therefore, predicting the values of the underlying index provides a number of opportunities in the investment field. In addition, a better model can be applied to predict stock prices.

Here we use:
- Econometric models (ARIMA, Hindman-Khandakar algorithm, ETS model, AutoETS, Naive Model)
- ML models (Linear Models, Boosting Algorithms, Support Vector Machine Regression, LARS, Passive Aggressive Regressor, MultiLayer Perceptron prediction)
- DL models (RNN, LSTM, GRU)
